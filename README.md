# Every Teen Seen
This app is here to help people come together in the Every Teen Seen 2018 Movement. The goal of this non profit organization is to reduce the amount of suicides in 2018 by 50 percent.
The reason I took on this project was because the owner was super passionate about what he was teaching and I really belived in what he was preaching. Since I believed so much in him I
offered to devlop this app for him completely free in hopes that I too could help make a difference.

## Frameworks and Technologies Used 
- Firebase
- Push Notifications
- Coredata 
- Codable / JSONSerialization 

## Firebase 
Firebase is by a ton of developers and at the time I had only used Cloudkit! So, instead using something that I with familar with I
wanted to get out of my confirt zone and try somethign else. I learned Firebase and now it handles all of my images, push notifications, and authentication. 
Since they came out with Firebase Firestore it has made querying data even faster meaning users don't have to wait as long, which is nice. 

## CoreData 
I used CoreData because I wanted the app to be able to save as much information as possible. It was important to me that users didn't have
to look at a long loading sign and CoreData helped me do that. I did run into a few hickups with working with Codable and Coredata, but I
was able to figure out a way to work around it. 

## Codable / JSONSerialization
When I used Codable for the first time I was so confused! After really diving into it I was able to save myself from writting a ton of 
code, which every developer wants to do! It does turn out that Codable and Cordata don't like working together. So, I did end up using
JSONSerialization for some things, which I think helped in the long run for me because at this time I was able to refresh myself with it
again. 

## Second App Ever Developed
If you made it this far I want to say thank you for your time and please download the app, I am hoping that the app will get used more
I am actually going to make it public for everyone who hosts events! If you're someone who is a developer and have used the app and have
any kind of feedback please share it with me : )
